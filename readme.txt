These data accompany the working paper Data policies of highly-ranked social science journals by the above authors.

It includes the following files:

1. studycomparison.tsv - tab separated data as coded
2. studycomparisonanalysis.Rmd - an Rmd file which includes R scripts for querying the data to return the results reported in the paper. It also generates the codebook with variable descriptions and summary statistics. The file will run if all libraries are installed and studycomparison.tsv is placed in the same folder
4. codebook_2019-08-26.txt - codebook with variable labels, descriptions, and summary statistics, auto-generated from data using the memisc::codebook command
